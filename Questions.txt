1. Retrieve the total number of orders placed.

select count(order_id) total_orders from order_details;

2. Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.

select sum(od.quantity * p.price) total_revenue
from order_details as od
join pizzas as p
on od.pizza_id = p.pizza_id;

3. Identify the highest-priced pizza.

select max(price) highest_price
from pizzas;


4. Identify the most common pizza size ordered.

select size,count(size) most_common_pizza_size
from pizzas
group by size
order by  most_common_pizza_size desc
limit 1;

5. List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.


select pt.pizza_type,od.quantity
from pizza_types as pt
join pizzas as p on pt.pizza_type = p.pizza_type_id
join order_details as od on od.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
group by pt.pizza_type,od.quantity
order by od.quantity desc
limit 5;

5. Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.

select pt.category,sum(od.quantity) as total_quantity
from pizza_types as pt
join pizzas as p on pt.pizza_type = p.pizza_type_id
join order_details as od on od.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
group by pt.category,od.quantity
order by total_quantity desc;

6. Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.

select extract(hour from time) per_hour ,count(order_id)
from orders
group by per_hour;

7. Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.

select category,count(pizza_type) as count_of_distrubuted_pizza
from pizza_types
group by category;

8. Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.

with cte as (select date,count(order_id) as count_orders
from orders
group by date)
select round(avg(count_orders))
from cte;

9. Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.

select pt.name,sum(od.quantity*p.price) as revenue
from pizza_types as pt
join pizzas as p on pt.pizza_type = p.pizza_type_id
join order_details as od on od.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
group by pt.name
order by revenue desc
limit 3;





Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.

with cte as (select pt.category,pt.name,sum(od.quantity*p.price)as revenue
from pizza_types as pt
join pizzas as p on pt.pizza_type = p.pizza_type_id
join order_details as od on od.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
group by pt.category,pt.name),
 cte2 as(select cte.*,
  row_number() over(partition by category order by revenue desc) as top_3_order 
from cte)
select * from 
cte2
where top_3_order in (1,2,3)
